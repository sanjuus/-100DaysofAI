# Week 2 🚀

##  👉 DAY 1 | streak 8

### Topic

- Vanishing Gradient Problem

### What I Learned

- What is vanishing gradient problem
- How can we find it in network training
- How to handle the problem
- Mathematical Intution

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented vanishing Gradinet problem
- Observed fiest layer networks weights are not updating
- Handled the problem by "Reducing the complexity of the network"
- Handled the problem by applying "ReLU activation function"
- Observed how the weights changed by handling the problem
 

##  👉 DAY 2 | streak 9

### Topic

- BeatsPerMinutes - kaggle competition (playground series - 9)

### What I Learned

- About the music data given in the dataset
- Feature extraction
- catboost model

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented Ctaboost for the competition
- Feature engineering - scaled, transformed, extracted
- Model building, prediction, evaluation
- Model submission
