# Week 2 ðŸš€

##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 1 | streak 8

### Topic

- Vanishing Gradient Problem

### What I Learned

- What is vanishing gradient problem
- How can we find it in network training
- How to handle the problem
- Mathematical Intution

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented vanishing Gradinet problem
- Observed fiest layer networks weights are not updating
- Handled the problem by "Reducing the complexity of the network"
- Handled the problem by applying "ReLU activation function"
- Observed how the weights changed by handling the problem
 

##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 2 | streak 9

### Topic

- BeatsPerMinutes - kaggle competition (playground series - 9)

### What I Learned

- About the music data given in the dataset
- Feature extraction
- catboost model

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented Catboost for the competition
- Feature engineering - scaled, transformed, extracted
- Model building, prediction, evaluation
- Model submission


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 3 | streak 10

### Topic

- Standardization (z-scaling)

### What I Learned 

- what is standardization?
- why do we use it?
- when to use?
- matheatical Intution
- Advantages and Disadvantages

### Practical Implementation

- Demonstrated Standardization
- Comapred with histplots and scatterplots
- Understanding the data before and after scaling


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 4 | streak 11

### Topic 

- categorical Encoding

### what I Learned

- what is categorical encoding
- types of categorical encoding
    - Ordinal Encoding
    - OneHot Encoding
    - Label Encoding
- How to use them?

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented all three types of categorical encoding
- observed changes
- demonstarted using the sklearn.preprocessing module


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 5 | streak 12

### Topic

- Sklearn pipeline

### What I learned

- what is sklearn pipeline?
- how to create it using
     - pipeline class
     - make_pipeline class
- how to add transformers to pipeline
- how to display pipleine using set_config

### Practical Implementation

- Demonstarted pipelines
- Implemnted weather classfication classifiaction using pipelines
- displayed the pipeline using set_config class
- predicted the weather succesfully


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 6 | streak 13

### Topic 

- Mathematical Transformations

### What I learned 

- I learn all the mathematical Transformations
     1. Function Transformations : 
        log Transformer,
        Reciprocal Transformer,
        Sqtt Transformer,
        Custom Transformer
     2. Power Transformations : 
        Box-Cox Transfromer,
        yeo-Johnson Transformer
     3. Quantile Transformations
- Where to apply which trabsforrmer?
- Understood all the transformers through sklearn

### Practical Implemetation
- Implemented all the transformations through dataset.
- Observed the changes in the data distribution.
- Understood all the transforms through results of histogram.
