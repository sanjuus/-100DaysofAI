# Week 2 ðŸš€

##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 1 | streak 8

### Topic

- Vanishing Gradient Problem

### What I Learned

- What is vanishing gradient problem
- How can we find it in network training
- How to handle the problem
- Mathematical Intution

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented vanishing Gradinet problem
- Observed fiest layer networks weights are not updating
- Handled the problem by "Reducing the complexity of the network"
- Handled the problem by applying "ReLU activation function"
- Observed how the weights changed by handling the problem
 

##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 2 | streak 9

### Topic

- BeatsPerMinutes - kaggle competition (playground series - 9)

### What I Learned

- About the music data given in the dataset
- Feature extraction
- catboost model

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented Catboost for the competition
- Feature engineering - scaled, transformed, extracted
- Model building, prediction, evaluation
- Model submission


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 3 | streak 10

### Topic

- Standardization (z-scaling)

### What I Learned 

- what is standardization?
- why do we use it?
- when to use?
- matheatical Intution
- Advantages and Disadvantages

### Practical Implementation

- Demonstrated Standardization
- Comapred with histplots and scatterplots
- Understanding the data before and after scaling


##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 4 | streak 11

### Topic 

- categorical Encoding

### what I Learned

- what is categorical encoding
- types of categorical encoding
    - Ordinal Encoding
    - OneHot Encoding
    - Label Encoding
- How to use them?

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented all three types of categorical encoding
- observed changes
- demonstarted using the sklearn.preprocessing module
