# Week 2 ðŸš€

##  ðŸ‘‰ DAY 1

### Topic

- Vanishing Gradient Problem

### What I Learned

- What is vanishing gradient problem
- How can we find it in network training
- How to handle the problem
- Mathematical Intution

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented vanishing Gradinet problem
- Observed fiest layer networks weights are not updating
- Handled the problem by "Reducing the complexity of the network"
- Handled the problem by applying "ReLU activation function"
- Observed how the weights changed by handling the problem
