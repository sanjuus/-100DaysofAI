# ðŸš€ Week 3

## ðŸ‘‰ Day 1 | streak 15

### Topic

- Univariet Imputation - Numeircal and Categorical

### What I Learned 

- what is univariet Imputation
- Types of Univariet Imputation
    - Numerical features  :  Mean/Median Imputation,Arbitary Value or constant Imputation, End of Distribution Imputation
    - Categorical features : Most Frequent or mode Imputation, Missing category Imputation
- When to use which Imputation?
- Advantages and Disadvanages

### Pracrical Implementation

- Implemnted univarinet Imputation.
- Applied all the related imputations on both numerical and categorical features.
- Observed changes in correlations, distributions, outliers , variance after Imputation using plots.


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 2 | streak 16

### Topic

- Multivarient Imputation

### What I learned : 

- what is multivarient Imputation?
- How to implement using :
      - KNN imputer
      - Iterative or MICE Imputer
- When to use?
- Advantages and Disadvantages
- Sklearn classes for KNN Iputer and Iteratie Imputer
- How they effect on distributions,variance, correlations and outliers.

### Pracrical Implementation

- Implemented KNN imputer and Iterative imputer
- observed distributions using plots of kde
- understood better by implementing from sklearn classes
