# ðŸš€ Week 3

## ðŸ‘‰ Day 1 | streak 15

### Topic

- Univariet Imputation - Numeircal and Categorical

### What I Learned 

- what is univariet Imputation
- Types of Univariet Imputation
    - Numerical features  :  Mean/Median Imputation,Arbitary Value or constant Imputation, End of Distribution Imputation
    - Categorical features : Most Frequent or mode Imputation, Missing category Imputation
- When to use which Imputation?
- Advantages and Disadvanages

### Pracrical Implementation

- Implemnted univarinet Imputation.
- Applied all the related imputations on both numerical and categorical features.
- Observed changes in correlations, distributions, outliers , variance after Imputation using plots.


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 2 | streak 16

### Topic

- Multivarient Imputation

### What I learned : 

- what is multivarient Imputation?
- How to implement using :
      - KNN imputer
      - Iterative or MICE Imputer
- When to use?
- Advantages and Disadvantages
- Sklearn classes for KNN Iputer and Iteratie Imputer
- How they effect on distributions,variance, correlations and outliers.

### Pracrical Implementation

- Implemented KNN imputer and Iterative imputer
- observed distributions using plots of kde
- understood better by implementing from sklearn classes


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 3 | streak 17

### Topic

- Outliers and Outliers Handling

### What I Learned

- What are outliers?
- Handling Techniques
       - Z-Score Method : Trim & Cap
       - IQR Method : Trim & Cap
       - Percentile Method : Trim & Cap
- various techniques to observe
       - box plots
       - Distributions
       - 5 way summary

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented all the handling techniques
- observed effects using various techniques
- Summarized before and after capping and trimming


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 4 | streak 18

### Topic 

- simple linear regression

### What I learned

- What is simple linear regression?
- Why do we use it?
- Solved Closed form solution (OLS) for SLR
- Understood Gemotrical Intution
- studied sklearn class for SLR

### Practical Implementation

- Implemneted simple linear regression from scratch
- Implemented simple linear regression using sklearn
- Observed the regression lines for different datasets using plots
- performed metrics to evalute those models.


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 5 | streak 19

### Topic

- Multiple Linear regression

### What I learned

- What is multiple linear regression(MLR)
- why do we use it?
- solved closed form solution(OLS) for MLR
- Understood Gemotrical Intution
- Studied sklearn class for MLR

###Practical implementation

- Implemneted multiple linear regression from scratch
- Implemented multiple linear regression using sklearn
- Observed the regreession lines for different datasets using plots
- performed metrics to evalute those models.
