# 🚀 Week 1 

## 👉 Day 1

### Topic 

- Perceptron and Modern Perceptron

### What I Learned

- What is perceptron?
- Gemotric view of perceptron
- Perceptron as a model
- Limitations of Perceptron

### Practical Implementaton

- Implemented the perceptron using PyTorch nn Module
- The modern perceptron using sigmoid function and Binary Cross Entropy.
- The scatter plot which tells how data is scattered
- The plot which shows the linear line which seperated the classes.
- Finally , The output with 200 epochs and 0.3 learning rate

## 👉 Day 2

### Topic

- Bank Churn Prediction using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### What I Learned

- What is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- How MLP differs from a simple perceptron
- Why MLP is powerful for learning non-linear decision boundaries
- The role of activation functions, hidden layers, backpropagation, and optimizers in MLP
- Why MLPs are suitable for structured/tabular data like customer churn prediction
- The challenge of class imbalance and why evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1) are important

### Practical Implementation

- Performed scaling and encoding on the dataset
- Explored data distributions and patterns using visualizations
- Plotted countplots for exited vs gender and geography
- Built and trained an MLP model using PyTorch
