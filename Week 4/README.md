# Week 4 ðŸš€

## ðŸ‘‰ Day 1 | Streak 22

### Topic

- Lasso Regularization

### What I Learned

- What is lasso Regularization?
- Why do we use it?
- Why lasso creates sparsity?
- Mathematical and Gemoetrical Intution
- Leraned Lasso class in sklearn and its attributes
### Practical Implementation

- Implemented Lasso using sklearn Lasso class
- Implemented with both multiple features and one independent and one dependent variable
- Observed the best-fit line with different alpha values using plots
- Observed the sparsity of coefficients while increasing alpha values


## ðŸ‘‰ Day 2 | Streak 23

### Topic

- Elastic Net Regularization

### What I Learned

- what is Elastic net regularization?
- why do we use it?
- Mathematical Intution
- Geometrical Intutuion
- Learned elastic net of sklearn and it's attributes

### Practical Implementation

- Implemented Elastic Net using a dataset
- Observed eature importances using plots
- observed difference between ridge,lasso and elastic net
